# Snake-Game
Console-based Snake Game

Snake game written in C++ (g++ compiler) that runs on the Linux command line in real-time.
Developed using Visual Studio Code on Ubuntu 20.04 (on Windows Subsystem for Linux)

To play:
The source code has to first be compiled using the g++ compiler. 
This can be done using the following command: g++ snake_v4.cpp -l ncurses (ncurses library has to be installed)
The executable can then be run using the command: ./a.out
The game will then start (see below for controls). The game will keep running until the snake collides with itself. After that, the program will terminate.

Controls:
